# Past Lover of the Duchess

Hails from Honolulu, Now goes by Kalani.
Doesn't want to be known as Moon on the Mountaintop 

Changed his name to Kalani because he had a massive debt to some pirate and to avoid the wrath of [[Skaarz Mystan]]s father

Still loves [[Skaarz Mystan]], but knows they will never be together. The new Dutchess will be forever grateful if they can find a way to marry them legitimately.

Might be possible with a forged letter of approval from her father

After a close encounter with the gang, Kalani fled to get audience, and protection, from [[Skaarz Mystan]]
